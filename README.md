# StripeStoreFrontExample
This is a storefront that will be created using basic market place. The point of the project is to show case the different ways that Stripe.js, Stripe Elements, and Stripe Checkout can be implemented. Once those three are implemented that is the minimum viable product for this project. Beyond that there will also be chances for custom integrations.
